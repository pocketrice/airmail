_Kotlin Fabric client/server mod (with Swift ornament) for seamless MacOS Airdrop integration._

<br>

Effectively a funky uncooperative solution to instantly sending items b/w players in "Vanillish" multiplayer servers that just so happen to all run on physically local MacOS instances.

Hold an item (or bundle!) and shake thrice to open Airdrop, then send to your recipient. The receiving player is then pinged with a flare and shortly afterwards your selected item is dropped off in a barrel Ã  la chicken courier. Simple as a clam!

The ornamental companion program only runs when you run the airmail mod. Due to the presumably overreaching nature of system permissions required to propagate between Minecraft and MacOS the program will be designed with as few permissions/features as possible to avoid the common pitfall of permission greed for tiny niche programs.
